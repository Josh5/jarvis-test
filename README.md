## Introduction

The Jarvis Web Gateway is a lightweight web-service designed to give Rich Internet Applications a rapid, powerful and secure mechanism to access and update server-side databases.  Jarvis can be configured to use Apache's “mod_perl” for better performance than simple CGI.
Jarvis supports fetch, create, update and delete with additional support for custom plug-in features.  Jarvis is based on the RESTful approach to http web services.  It provides JSON, XML interfaces, with additional support for CSV and MS Excel downloads.  
Jarvis works excellently with JavaScript web apps using Angular, ExtJS, Dojo and many other JS toolkits, and is also ideal for client applications such as those written in Adobe Flex.
Jarvis supports any database for which a Perl DBI driver exists.  This include Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, SQLite and more.
