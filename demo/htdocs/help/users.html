This screen allows "admin" users to maintain the list of permitted users on
the demo system.  Users are either "admin" or "not-admin", controlled by a
flag in the databasem, which is represented here as a checkbox.<p>

Access to this screen is controlled by the read/write flags on the dataset.
That security is all performed on the server side, so JavaScript hackers
will not get very far.<p>

There are of course a couple of security weaknesses on the demo application.
Firstly, the list of users is shown as a pulldown in the login screen.  This
is done to show the use of the read="**" feature which allows some datasets
to be accessible even to users which have not been logged in.<p>

<table class="helptable">

<tr><td class="note"><b>Has Password?</b></td><td>A YES or NO string indicating
if the user currently has a password field configured.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="note"><b>Admin?</b></td><td>A checkbox denoting if the user
has administrator access.  Admin access is required to view the Users screen.</td></tr>

If you mark all users as "not Admin", then when you logout, you will naturally
no longer be able to log back in to grant Admin access.  In that case, you will
need to use SQLite directly to reset the "is_admin" flag in the "users" table
in the database.<p>

Use the "Set Password" to set a new password for the currently selected user.
You will not be able to view the existing password, as it is stored in encrypted
format in the database.<p>
