The Jarvis package depends on a number of lower-level packages.  

Please refer to the Jarvis installation guide for information on installing
into RedHat, CentOS, and Ubuntu.  Almost everything you need should be 
available via "apt-get" or "yum".

For the few exceptions (or for everything, if you don't have access to the
package manager), please visit:
