Introduction
================================================================================

Following these instructions will allow you to create a Jarvis Docker image.
You can then easily run this image as a "container", which will automatically start up
a fully functional web server hosting Jarvis for you. This will also allow you
to easily build other Docker images that are built upon Jarvis.

    What is Docker? See here:
    
    https://www.docker.com/whatisdocker/
    
Docker is required for this, so please follow the instructions relevant to your system from this page:
    
    https://docs.docker.com/installation/#installation
    
================================================================================
Installation
================================================================================
    
Follow these instructions to set up your Docker image:

    1) Run the build.sh script in this folder (internet connectivity is required for this).
       This script takes a Jarvis Debian package as an argument.
       For example:
       
           sudo ./build.sh jarvis_6.1.1-1_all.deb
           
       The Jarvis image is built upon the base Ubuntu 14.04 image, which is 200mb.
       Building may take several minutes due to this and the dependecies required for Jarvis.
           
    2) Once step 1 is complete, you need to rename the Docker image that was created.
       By default the image will be referenced porse-educators_2.5.4-2_all.debby an ID, so rename it with
       
           sudo docker tag <id> jarvis
           
       <id> is the ID of the Docker image, which will be output at the end of step 1.
       You can also find the ID with the command "sudo docker images".
       
       Although this image will run fine with any name, other images that are built upon
       Jarvis will depend on this image being named "jarvis". Therefore it is recommended
       to name it as such.
       
================================================================================
Using The Docker Image
================================================================================

You're done! You may now run the Docker image as a container:

       sudo docker run -d -p 7533:80 jarvis
       
This will run the Apache web server in a container, already configured.
The "-p" flag here specifies the port that you'd like to connect to the site on
(7533 is used as an example). As Apache runs on port 80, this part can't be
changed, but you may use any port you like in place of 7533.
   
You now can connect to localhost:7533 (or whichever port you specified) to ensure
that the site is working correctly.

If you wish to use the Jarvis image you've created for a purpose other than running
Jarvis, you can use the --entrypoint flag with the run command followed by the command you
wish to execute. For example:

    sudo docker run -t -i --entrypoint=/bin/bash jarvis
    
Here the -t flag means "TTY output" and the -i flag makes it interactive, which is required
to run an interactive bash session in the container. More information on the run command can
be found here: https://docs.docker.com/reference/run/

After starting the container, you may wish to check that it's running using

    sudo docker ps
    
which displays the running containers. You can then find the ID of such a container here,
and stop it or remove it with "sudo docker stop <id>" or "sudo docker rm <id>".
