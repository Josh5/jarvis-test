Description: Extensible RESTful server for any DBI-supported database.
 Jarvis is a server which provides HTTP access to any SQL-based database known
 to the Perl DBI library.  You can provide SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE access
 to any database table by writing SQL statements with no coding required.

 However, for advanced features you can write Perl "plugins" and "hooks" which
 deal with situations where SQL alone is not sufficient.

 Jarvis can be used with any HTTP client.  It has been extensively tested with 
 jQuery, ExtJS and Flex clients in all major browsers.

 An extensive PDF documentation manual is provided.  It contains the package
 change log, and describes the process of integrationg Jarvis.
