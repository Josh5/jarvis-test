<!--
     This dataset provides a list of the errors that have occurred.
     First REST parameter can be the application, if so wanted.
     Second REST parameter can be the user, if so wanted.

     It then identifies how many errors in a specific error is - 
     either an error given by a specific ID, or an error given by
     a date.

     Filter criteria can be provided, the same as the 'errors.xml'
     dataset.

     Note that we add a day to the date (by subtracting 1), because
     we want to show the user the last errors on the given date, not
     start the user off immediately after that date.
