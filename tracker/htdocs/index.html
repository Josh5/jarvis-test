    The Jarvis Tracker GUI main entry point.

    The Jarvis Tracker GUI is a web based UI (which works in recent browsers) allowing
    users to access data stored in the Jarvis tracker database. Please refer to the
    Jarvis documentation for how to configure Jarvis for more information on configuring
    the tracker.

    HTML help is provided in the application to provide information on the various aspects
    of the UI.

    The application itself is built on ExtJS - so the actual page rendering is handed off
    to ExtJS and the rest of the application is written in JavaScript.

    This HTML file loads the required javascript and then passes the initialisation off
    to the code in 'tracker.js'.
